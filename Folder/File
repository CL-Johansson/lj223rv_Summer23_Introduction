<h1>Examination 3</h1>

<h3>Super sorry for having to make this in HTML</h3>

<div id="Description">

<p>Below are my the images as requested and the code I used for 
the Markdown but seemed to absolutely be against working at all, 
so had to do it here, sorry again, hope its okay...</p>

<p>Also I felt obligated to style this exam a tiny bit, my inner creative was crying 
    seeing it as basic white background and I was very bored</p>
