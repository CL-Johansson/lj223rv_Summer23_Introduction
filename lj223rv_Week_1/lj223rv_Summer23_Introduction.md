<p style="text-align:center;">I am very excited to start studying this program, coming from a background in urban planning with a specialization in <em>geographical information systems</em> (GIS) and <em>remote sensing</em>. I have had some small introduction to coding and data analysis during the last three years, working a bit with SQL, FME and some light versions of machine learning in various types of geo-analysis. Something I had the opportunity to dive deep into during my thesis, if you are interested what it was about, check out this <a href="http://mosaic.lnec.pt/pdfs/publicacoes_out2022/artigos/Barros_etal_2022.pdf">link</a>!</p> 

<p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:15px; color:#5885AF; margin-bottom:25px;">In general, I am very new to the world of coding, but very excited to learn more and explore!</p>

As previously mentioned I have a tiny bit of experience with coding but far from proficient in any way, I hope that in the coming semester I will have the opportunity to learn and challenge myself in new and exciting ways, such as through: 

- Getting deep into javascript 
- Learning more about HTML and CSS, designing webpages and things is awesome! 

<br>
But also having the opportunity to work with a diverse group of coders, the incentive for self-learning and taking on projects is but a few of the things that attracted me here. More things include:

<br>

1. Opportunities for industry / university interaction and learning
2. Awesome projects and hoping for fun internships
